```html
<form action="\home"></form>
```

CSS is *Cascading Style Sheets*, and can be called **inline**, **internatlly**, or **externally**:


```html
<!--- inline CSS --->
<div style="background-color: blue"></div>
```

```html
<!--- internal CSS -->
<head>
    <style>
        div { background-color: blue }
    </style>
</head>
```

```html
<!-- external CSS (recommended) -->
<head>
    <!-- rel is relative, and identifies the type of link-->
    <link rel="myStyleSheet" href="myStyleSheet.css">
</head>
