# Overview
This directory contains the work for labs 5.4 to 5.8 (friends MVC architecture proj, upto Swagger documentation). I have currently left out unit testing extension work but intend to mark this as a TODO to revisit in the future.


# Lab 5.8 Part 1
- Write the Swagger specification for your entire project so far!

# Lab 5.8 Part 2 :
### Final Module Project
- Using what you learnt in this module, recreate the Fake eCommerce Store that you have
created in Module 4. Move your front-end files to the public folder, and create an Express
back-end to handle all third-party data fetching using axios. Your front end should then
fetch from your back-end instead of the fake store API directly.
Make sure to make a clean MVC Structure and use Swagger to test things out, and make a
documentation that is easy to read and test.
