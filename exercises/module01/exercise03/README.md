# exercise 03
Using some starter code:

- Style your buttons with CSS - Add a script tag with two JS
functions, one for each button
- Clicking each button should change
the background colour and the
heading text for that column.
Extension: add text fields under the
headings, and replace the heading text
with the value of the text fields when the
buttons are clicked!
