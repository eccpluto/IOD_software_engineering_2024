# Module 6 Exercise 2 and 4

## Exercise 2
- Create a BigCats component, in its own file, which uses
the cats array (below) to display a styled list of cats.

- Include a unique id and fix the warning about keys

- Create a SingleCat component for rendering each
individual cat, and add an image property for each one.

## Exercise 4
- Extend your BigCats component from Exercise 2 to
include buttons for alphabetically sorting and reversing the
list

- Add another button to filter the list and display only the
cats in the ‘Panthera’ family, and one to reset and show
the full list.
